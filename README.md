## Wikipedia articles made pretty

Hello and welcome. In this project, I turn Wikipedia articles into prettier versions of themselves with the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a personal playground where I practice these technologies and is not meant as an expansion or quality check of the articles.

You are welcome to use any code here that you like, or suggest ideas or changes.
